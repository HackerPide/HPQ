  <h5 align="center">This modpack is aimed at optimizing game performance and making quality of life changes to the vanilla Minecraft experience.</h5>
  <h5 align="center">Quilt or Fabric Loader is required.</h5>
</div>

## Installation
- I recommend using [PrismLauncher with Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/install/prismlauncher/)
- ~~Download [modpack and config(1.19.1)](https://github.com/HackerPide/HPQ/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)~~
  - This will be available on the launcher itself in the future
    - You can use `Fabulously Optimized` until then
- Add Instance -> Import 

## TODO
- [ ] Make it a modpack for PrismLauncher(CurseForge/Modrinth)
- [ ] Fix/update mods for 1.20.4
- [ ] Add a wiki of sorts to link and explain every included mod
